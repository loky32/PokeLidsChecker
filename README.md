# PokeLidsChecker

A simple app to keeping track PokéLids that you visited around Japan. Please check the official website for more information about PokéLids: https://local.pokemon.jp/en/manhole/

# How it works?

Select the region in the japanese map, then you can choose the prefectures and locations for this region.
Choose a lid in the list to see an image of reference, the pokémon presents in the lid and checkbox to mark if you obtained the lid.
You will have 2 buttons with Google Maps links, the first to display all the lids of the prefecture and the second to display only the selected lid.
To see your progress you will see 3 bars, one for location, another one for prefecture and finally a total bar (currently 322 lids).
