# How it works?

Select the region in the Japan's map, then you can choose the prefectures and locations for this region.
Choose a lid in the numered list to see information like an image of reference, the pokémon presents in the lid, a button to see the location with GoogleMaps and a checkbox to mark if you obtained the lid.
